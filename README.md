## Introduction

Cherrypicker is a data science and machine learning (ML) project focused on using predictive analytics to distinguish between two classes of leaf images: healthy and infected.

The project is designed to support an agri-food business currently facing an outbreak of powdery mildew in its cherry tree plantations. At present, identifying infected trees is done manually‚Äîa process that is both time-consuming and labour-intensive.

To address this, we propose developing an ML model capable of detecting powdery mildew from photographs of cherry tree leaves. This solution aims to streamline the inspection process, reduce operational workload, and improve the speed and accuracy of treatment decisions, ultimately supporting more effective disease management.

The project is hosted on the streamlit app and a live version may be found [here](https://project-5-mildew-detection.onrender.com/)

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

Hypothesis üß†: Cherry leaves affected by powdery mildew exhibit consistent visual features that can be detected and accurately classified by a machine learning model.

---

Validation Strategy ‚úÖ:

- Step 1: Visual Analysis

    To assess whether visual differences exist between healthy and infected leaves, average and variability images were generated for each class. These helped confirm the hypothesis that consistent patterns are visible and could be leveraged by a machine learning model.

    The below images show a selection of healthy leaves:

    ![Healthy Leaves](assets/images/healthy_leaves.png)

    And leaves where powdery mildew is present:

    ![Infected Leaves](assets/images/infected_leaves.png)

    To generate the average and variability images used for validation, sample images (like those shown above) were loaded into an array after determining their dimensions. A custom function was then used to compute and visualize the mean and variability across the dataset. Below are the resulting average and variability images for both healthy and infected leaves.

    ![Average & variability for healthy leaves](assets/images/average-healthy.png)

    ![Average & variability for infected leaves](assets/images/average_infected.png)

    From the photographs and results of the analysis, it appears that the hypothesis is correct and there is a visual difference. We may therefore consider the hypothesis validated.

- Step 2: Model Training

    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on a labeled dataset of cherry leaf images. The model was designed to learn and classify features that distinguish healthy from infected leaves.

- Step 3: Performance Evaluation

    The model‚Äôs performance was assessed using a combination of classification metrics and training diagnostics to ensure both accuracy and generalization.

    ‚úÖ Metrics Used:

    - Overall Accuracy

    - Confusion Matrix
  
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score (per class)

    These metrics helped evaluate not only how often the model was correct, but how well it distinguished between healthy and infected leaves under different conditions.

    Training and validation loss over epochs.

    ![Loss](assets/images/loss.png)

    These graphs show that the model learned effectively, with minimal overfitting and consistent improvement across epochs.

- Step 4: Deployment & Testing

    The final model was deployed within a Streamlit dashboard, allowing users to upload new leaf images and receive real-time predictions. This ensured practical, real-world usability for the client.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

| Business Requirement                  | ML/Visualisation Task                                               | Rationale                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual differentiation of leaf health | Create average, variability, and difference images + image montages | Provides insight into common visual traits of each class |
| Predict mildew presence               | Train binary classification CNN                                     | Automates detection with scalable performance            |
| Usability via dashboard               | Streamlit dashboard with upload & prediction                        | Ensures non-technical users can access results easily    |

## ML Business Case

Problem: Visual inspection of leaves is time-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable.

Solution: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on cherry leaf images can classify leaves as ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù or ‚ÄúPowdery Mildew‚Äù instantly.

Benefits:

- Reduces inspection time from 30 minutes to seconds

- Enhances crop quality assurance

- Scalable to other crops and use cases

- Performance Metric: Must achieve at least 97% accuracy to be considered successful by the client.

## Issues

During deployment, the app exceeded the size limit imposed by the hosting platform (Render). Despite efforts to reduce the size by adding unnecessary files and folders to .slugignore, the project remained too large to deploy successfully.

To resolve this, the following adjustment was made:

Downgraded Python version from 3.12 to 3.11 to reduce dependency bloat and ensure compatibility with smaller library builds.
